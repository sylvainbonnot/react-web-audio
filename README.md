# React + Web Audio
In this fork of [react-web-audio](https://github.com/philnash/react-web-audio), I add a component to display simultaneously a waveform + frequency viewer, from a microphone input.
This is an example application that shows how to visualise audio from the microphone using the Web Audio API in React.
